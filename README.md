  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

  This application uses the Inquirer and Jest packages.

  ## Usage

  As a manager, keeping track of all of my employee's information can be challenging. This command-line application allows managers to input team member information. After, an HTML file is generated that displays the information in an easy-to-read format. If a manager/user clicks an email address, then the default email program opens. If a manager/user clicks the GitHub username, then the GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
